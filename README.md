Abel Tezare – Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

I am a software engineering student passionate about coding, problem-solving, and building projects that showcase my skills. This portfolio contains some of my work in Python, Java, JavaScript, and web development.

Note: This portfolio is a work in progress. Some projects are included to demonstrate my skills and may not represent fully functional applications.

I am continuously updating it with new projects and improvements. Feel free to explore my work and provide feedback!
